In designing any spur gear, We must know about: 
- Module
- Number of teeth
- Pressure Angle

To find the diameter
Diameter = Module * number of teeth.

To find outer diameter: 
Outer diameter = ( Number of teeth +2 ) * Module
> [!NOTE]
> 2 is constant for all gears since it is an equation to find the outer diameter for all gears in life.
